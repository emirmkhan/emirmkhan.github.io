    <h3 style='color:orange'>Big and small airports</h3>
</html>

<html>
    <p style='color:Orange'>In this chapter of big and small airports you’ll learn about choosing airports, airport codes, and hubs. After this chapter,  you will be through 1 step of flying! Big and small airports have a difference. In this chapter, the 3 most important things for a reason to fly a big or small airport are: choosing  airports, airport codes, and hubs. Choosing airports is way more important than you expected. If you’re a beginner traveler and you’re flying a small flight, then choose a small airport. If you’re an experienced traveler and your flying international, chose a big airport. An airport code is a shorter 3-digit name for an airport. (eg. San Francisco international airport: SFO). A hub is a home airport for an airline. (eg. jetBlue’s  hub is New York). Now you’re in the airport, what’s the terminal? In this chapter you learned about big and small airports, how to choose from the types of airports, a shorter way to call an airport, and how some airports are home to some airlines.</p>

    <h3 style='color:Orange'>Terminals</h3>
</html>
     <p style='color:orange'>In this chapter, you’re going to learn about terminals, the airlines in it, how terminals numbered and lettered, and the International terminal. If you're flying United at SFO and you use Terminal 2, you're not going to get to the United check-in!  To know which terminal and door you’re using, check the airline’s app, your boarding pass, or the airport signs. If there was no lettered or numbered  terminals, then when you type in your GPS Terminal 2 (in the bay area), It might take you to SJC! The bigger airport in the area has numbered terminals , the smaller airport in the area  has lettered terminals (ex. (in the bay area) SFO has got numbered terminals, SJC has lettered terminals.) If you're going to fly international, you will use the International terminal. The international terminal only has international flights. International means out of the country. If you're flying international, you need your passport. Now you’re in the terminal, let's go through security. In this chapter you learned about terminals, and it’s airlines, how it’s 
numbered and lettered, and the international terminal.</p>

    <h3 style='color:Orange'>Security</h3>
</html>

<html>
    <p style='color:Orange'>This chapter is about security, items that won’t pass security, types of security, each terminal’s security. imagine that you’re going through security and something doesn’t go through. If you don’t want that to happen, follow the 3-1-1 Directions. 3: ounces (oz) in a ziplock bag. 1: 1 ziplock bag. 1: 1 under seat item. And follow these directions too: no weapons, no metal, no medicine, no liquids, no food, no water. If you need one of these items, after security there are shops where you can buy stuff. There are different types of security. Some types of security is for the crew, and some types of security is for passengers. There are 2 different types of passenger security: there is TSA and TSA precheck. TSA precheck is faster than TSA. Each terminal has their own security. There is no security just in the middle of the airport. Each terminal’s security has lanes. One terminal can have multiple securities. You went through security, where is the gate? In this chapter you learned about security, items that won’t pass security, types of security, each terminal’s security.</p>

    <h3 style='color:Orange'>Gates</h3>
</html>

<html>
    <p style='color:Orange'>In this chapter your going to learn about gates, concourses, numbers, and terminal’s gates. If you were in a big airport and there were no concourses and you were going to gate 17, You might go to the wrong gate 17 and that’s why we have concourses. (ex. B17 and F17 have a difference). You probably do know numbers, but this is a different type of numbers. You know how I said if there was no concourses, you would go to the wrong gate 17? But, that's only for big airports. Small airports have no concourses. Instead, they have 1 gate 17, and it's the right gate 17. Terminals own some gates. When it’s a big airport, 1 terminal can own 1 or more concourscees. Earlier in this article, I said “you have to go the right airline” so all the airlines in one terminal will takeoff in the terminal’s gates. Now you're at the gate and ready to takeoff. In this chapter you learned about gates, concourses, numbers, and terminal’s gates.</p>
